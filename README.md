graphql-query-to-json
=====================

This is a simple module that takes a graphQL query string and converts it into a JSON object. Think of it as the reverse of the excellent module [json-to-graphql-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-to-graphql-query).

# Debugging
Run the VSCode configuration "Jest" and set a breakpoint in the code wherever you feel the need to inspect.
